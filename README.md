Here I share the code using in Lehmann et al., 2022 
The inversion model creates two phases of activity from 10Be \
surface exposure dating from the Vallon de la Route rock glacier (Combeynot Massif, France). 
 
In the excel file "Cosmo data" are shared the 10Be surface exposure age of boulders at the 
surface of the Vallon de la Route rock glacier. 
The sampling have been done in October 2020. 
The file contain also the ID of each sample, their elevation  and distance to the headwall (cliff at the summit of the rock glacier).

Details of the sampled (Longitude, Latitude, Elevation) are shared in the excell file "Samples_details". 
Those measurement have been done using a hand GPS.

The code file is written in Matlab language. In the code we simulate the 10Be
surface-exposure age structure of the rock glacier complex
for 100 scenarios. For each scenario, two phases of activity with different 
surface velocity are set with different starting time and ending time. 

For more information please refer to Lehmann et al., 2022.
